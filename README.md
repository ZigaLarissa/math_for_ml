## Formative One Visualization

### Introduction
This GitHub repository, named "math_for_ml," is dedicated to the first formative assessment focusing on visualization. The assignment involves the exploration and visualization of data related to transport, specifically vehicle and fuel efficiency. The key components of the repository are detailed below.

### Directory Structure

#### 1. **Formative_one_visualization**
   - This directory contains all the necessary files related to the formative assessment.

   ##### a. **visualizations_notebook.ipynb**
   - The "visualizations_notebook" is a Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step guide for generating histograms and a heatmap. It includes prompts and instructions that guided the process of writing code to visualize the given data.

   ##### a. **visualizations_codes.py**
   - The "visualizations_codes" is a python file that provides all the lines of codes used in the notebook to generate the graphs acquired.

#### 2. **exported_images**
   - This directory stores the exported images resulting from the code execution in the notebook.

   ##### a. **co2_distribution.png**
   - Image file representing the first histogram.

   ##### b. **car_brands.png**
   - Image file representing the second histogram.

   ##### c. **fuel_efficiency.png**
   - Image file representing the third histogram.

   ##### d. **heat_map.png**
   - Image file representing the heatmap generated from the data.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZigaLarissa/math_for_ml.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "Formative_one_visualization" directory:
   ```bash
   cd math_for_ml/Formative_one_visualization
   ```

3. Open the "visualizations_notebook.ipynb" notebook using Jupyter or any compatible notebook viewer.

4. Follow the prompts and instructions in the notebook to execute the code and generate visualizations.

5. View the exported images in the "exported_images" directory to visualize the histograms and heatmap.
